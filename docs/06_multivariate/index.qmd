# multivariate analysis

- more than one response variable (or DV)
- focus on causal relationships / patterns of associations between variables
- modeling framework: Structural Equation Models (SEM)
  - [structural model]{style="color:yellow;"}: path / mediation analysis
  - [measurement model]{style="color:yellow;"}: CFA, full SEM

## the SEM framework

- brings together regression & psychometrics
  - making it possible to take measurement error/ reliability into account
- allows for estimation of indirect and direct (causal) effects

## Also Known As (AKA)

- covariance structure analysis/modeling
- Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS)
- Linear Structural Relations (LISREL)

**other families of SEM:**

- variance-based SEM / partial least squares path Modeling (PLS-PM), common in marketing/organizational research
- structural causal model (SCM) or nonparametric SEM
  - directed graphs (DAG / DCG)

## what SEM does

- analyst specifies a model based on domain knowledge
- estimate model parameters to minimize the difference between:
  - sample covariance matrix (observed)
  - covariance matrix implied by the model

can estimate means too, but usually focus is on covariances

## history of SEM {.smaller}

- Sewell Wright (geneticist) method of path coefficients (1934)
- introduced to social sciences by Blalock (1961) and others
- led to integration of regression with factor-analytic techniques (JWK model) Karl Jöreskog, J. W. Keesling, D. Wiley
- first publicly available computer program was LISREL III by Jöreskog & Sörbom (1976)

## where SEM is mostly used {.smaller}

- industrial/organisational psychology
- marketing
- educational psychology
- health sciences
- psychological assessment
- neuropsychology
- political sciences
- economics

::: {.aside}

mostly observational / nonexperimental studies, but also, experimental / quasi-experimental studies [(Breitsohl, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428118754988)

## disadvantages / challenges {.smaller}

- NOT a tool for causal discovery
- it is a "large-sample technique"
  - [N:q rule]{style="color:yellow;"}, ratio of number of cases (N) to number of model parameters needing estimates (q). 20:1 is recommended [(Jackson 2003)](https://doi.org/10.1207/S15328007SEM1001_6)
  - most published SEM studies are probably based on samples that are too small [(Loehlin & Beaujean, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315643199)
  - most do not adequately report:
    - rationale for SEM, for sample size, missing data, reliability of variables, correspondence between model & data [(Zhang et al. 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8551.12415)
- assumes linearity / multivariate normality

## a simple regression model


# manifest vs latent

in the social sciences, we often can only measure 'proxies' for the true theoretical constructs that we are interested in (e.g., happiness, job satisfaction, self-esteem, statistics anxiety, social capital)

## importance of reliability

- [incremental validity]{style="color:yellow;"}: does a predictor have an effect on some response *after controlling for a second predictor?*
- multiple regression assumes perfect score reliability!

Type I error rates of significance tests are surprisingly high even in large samples (N = 300) with moderate levels of predictor reliability (.8) in analyses with 2 predictors

"incremental validity" better supported by SEM

## SEM analysis workflow {.smaller}

1. specify the model
2. evaluate whether the model is identified
3. select measures (operationalize) and collect data
4. analyze the model
   - if fit is poor, respecify (step 5) if justified by theory; if not, retain no model
   - if model retained, interpret parameter estimates
   - consider equivalent / near-equivalent models
5. respecify
6. report the results

## model specification

represent your hypotheses as equations or (more commonly) as a path diagram

- [endogenous variable]{style="color:yellow;"}: one or more causal paths leading into it
- [intervening variable]{style="color:yellow;"}: one or more causal path leading in and one or more leading out
- [exogenous variable]{style="color:yellow;"}: one or more causal path leading out, none leading in

**guided by domain knowledge, not by the analysis!**

## model identification {.smaller}

- analyzing a SEM requires deriving estimates for parameters in a set of *simultaneous equations*
- a parameter is 'identified' if a unique value can be found given the model and the data matrix

| Term                                                                           | Description                         |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| [under-identified]{style="color:yellow;"}                                      | at least one unidentified parameter |
| [just-identified]{style="color:yellow;"} or [saturated]{style="color:yellow;"} | data complexity = model complexity  |
| [over-identified]{style="color:yellow;"}                                       | model simpler than data             |

::: {.notes}

a model is
- under-identified: contains at least one unidentified param (model too simple for the data)
- just-identified or saturated (model 'just right' for the data); usually scientifically vapid
- over-identified (model simpler than the data; can be disconfirmed)

example:
- fitting a line to a single point
- fitting a line to two points
- fitting a line to 10 points

identification should be done /before/ collecting any data; it is a function of the number of measures (variables) and the structure of the model, NOT the sample size!
