## what is mediation?

> "strict causal hypothesis... about the way in which... one variable causes *changes* in another variable, which in turn causes *changes* in an outcome variable" (Little, 2013, p. 287)

**NB** mediation is not a method for 'causal discovery'!

## example

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}

```{r}
#| include: false
options(tidyverse.quiet=TRUE)
library("tidyverse")
library("lavaan")

wpdat <- read_csv("https://psyteachr.github.io/stat-models-v2/data/workplace.csv",
                  col_types = "ddd")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
wpdat
```
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
- `IP`: prop in-person working (0 - 1)
- `OI`: organizational intelligence (1 - 100)
- `PR`: productivity (1 - 100)

each row is data from a single firm

See [online workbook](https://psyteachr.github.io/stat-models-v2/mediation.html) for data and code for this example. **NB**: this is *simulated* (not real) data

## relationship between IP and PR? {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: false
mod_unmediated <- lm(PR ~ IP, data = wpdat)
summary(mod_unmediated)
```

## direct, indirect, and total effects

- **direct effect**: effect of $X$ on $Y$ *controlling for the mediation*
- **indirect effect**: the *product* of path coefficients $a$ and $b$
- **total effect**: the sum of the indirect effect and direct effects

## model estimation

![](img/mediation_paths.png){fig-align="center"}

## significance of indirect effect?

- label regression coefficients in `lavaan`
- use `:=` ("is defined as") to compute and label effects
- use *bootstrapping* for standard errors
  - because Sobel statistic (test statistic / SE) assumes normality, likely to be violated for product estimator

our results:

$\beta = 16.032$, $SE = 2.153$, $z = 7.445$, $p < .001$

## partial vs complete mediation

- did the direct effect 'survive' the mediation? (No)

direct effect: $\beta = 0.162$, $SE = 2.922$, $z = 0.055$, $p = 0.956$

- what proportion of the total effect is explained by the mediation?

our results suggest that 99% of the total effect is accounted for by the indirect effect

## mediation analysis: assumptions

- in addition to the standard path model assumptions:
  - *temporal precedence*: changes precede their effects by a finite amount of time
  - *modularity*: parts are potentially isolatable
  - all directions of causal effects are correct
  - no unmeasured confounders for any pair of variables
  - mediator variable must be continuous (though other approaches exist: see g-computation by Muthen)

::: {.aside}
if assumptions not met, parameter estimates may not be meaningful
:::

## mediation in cross-sectional designs? {.smaller}

Hyman-Tate criterion: there must be at least a *conceptual* time-ordering if study is cross-sectional

1. does the cause conceptually exist before the mediator?
2. does the mediator conceptually exist before the outcome?

This means that:

- trait variables (cognitive ability or chronic anxiety) cannot mediate between cause and outcome, because they are not changeable
- group-level characteristics (norms, stereotypes) cannot be mediators because they are constants applying over all people in particular groups

## spurious mediation

mediator merely correlated with another unmeasured variable that is the actual mediator, or mediator is actually a consequence of the outcome

## formative assignment {.smaller}
